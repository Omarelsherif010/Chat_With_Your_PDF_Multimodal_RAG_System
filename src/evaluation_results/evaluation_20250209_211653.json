      "question": "How is the scaled dot product attention calculated?",
      "response": "The Scaled Dot-Product Attention is calculated by first computing the dot products of the input query with all keys. The dimension of the queries and keys is denoted as dk. The values, on the other hand, have a dimension of dv. After the dot products are computed, each is divided by the square root of dk (\u221adk). Then, a softmax function is applied to the resultant values to determine the weights on the values. These weights are computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. This process is similar to dot-product attention, except for the scaling factor of \u221a1/dk.",
