      "response": "The Scaled Dot-Product Attention is calculated by computing the dot products of the query with all keys. The inputs consist of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. The resulting values are then divided by the square root of dk (√dk). Following this, a softmax function is applied to these values to obtain the weights on the values. These weights are used to compute the final value of the attention function. This approach is called \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" because it involves a scaling factor of √1/dk in the dot-product attention computation. This method is faster and more space-efficient in practice than additive attention functions, which compute the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.",

To address this issue, they propose restricting self-attention to a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence, increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r). They also investigate the use of convolutional layers with kernel width k < n, which requires a stack of O(n/k) or O(logk(n)) layers.\n\n**Model Complexity and Efficiency**\n\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, but separable convolutions significantly decrease complexity to O(k · n · d + n · d2). However, even with k = n, the complexity of a separable convolution is comparable to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, which is the approach taken in their model.\n\n**Interpretability and Attention Distributions**\n\nSelf-attention can yield more interpretable models, as attention distributions from their models reveal individual attention heads learning to perform different tasks and exhibiting behavior related to syntactic and semantic structure.\n\n**Training Regime**\n\nThe authors describe their training regime for their models, including:\n\n* Training data and batching: using the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets with byte-pair encoding and batched together by approximate sequence length.\n* Hardware and schedule: training on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs with a total of 100,000 to 300,000 training steps.\n* Optimizer: using the Adam optimizer with a varied learning rate and warmup steps.\n* Regularization: employing three types of regularization during training."
