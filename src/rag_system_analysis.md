# RAG System Analysis: Challenges and Agentic Solutions

## Current System Overview

Based on analysis of our current implementation in `src/cached_retriever.py` and `src/evaluate_rag.py`, our RAG system provides:
- Multimodal retrieval (text, tables, images)
- CLIP-based image embeddings
- Text-based similarity search
- Basic query analysis
- Response generation using GPT-4

### Architecture Components
- **Document Processing Pipeline**
  - LlamaParse for PDF extraction
  - Text chunking strategy (500/100)
  - Document structure preservation

- **Embedding Systems**
  - OpenAI embeddings (1536d)
  - CLIP for images (512d)
  - Pinecone vector stores

- **Current Performance Baseline**
  - Actual metrics from evaluation_results/evaluation_summary_20250209_212032.json
  - RAGAS evaluation scores
  - Response generation times

## Current Challenges and Agentic RAG Solutions

### 1. Context Length Limitation

**Current Implementation (from cached_retriever.py):**
- Fixed chunk size in text splitter (500 tokens with 100 overlap)
- Static retrieval window (k=4 for text, k=2 for images/tables)
- May miss important context or include irrelevant information

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Implement Adaptive Context Agent that:
  - Dynamically adjusts chunk sizes based on semantic completeness
  - Uses hierarchical chunking for nested context
  - Maintains cross-references between chunks
  - Adjusts retrieval window based on query complexity

**Benefits:**
- Better context preservation
- Reduced token wastage
- Improved response coherence
- Dynamic handling of varying content lengths

### 2. Query Understanding

**Current Implementation Challenge:**
- Simple keyword matching
- No query intent analysis
- Limited handling of complex queries
- Low completeness scores in evaluation

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Deploy Query Intelligence Agent:
  - NLP-based intent classification
  - Query decomposition
  - Context-aware query reformulation
  - Multi-hop question handling

**Expected Improvements:**
- Completeness score target: >0.85
- Query understanding accuracy: >90%
- Complex query handling success: >80%

### 3. Static Retrieval Strategy

**Current Implementation Challenge:**
- Same retrieval approach for all queries
- Fixed weighting between text and image results
- Limited integration of different content types

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Implement Strategy Agent that:
  - Selects optimal retrieval methods per query
  - Dynamically weights different content types
  - Combines multiple retrieval strategies
  - Adapts to user feedback and query patterns

**Benefits:**
- Query-specific optimization
- Better multimodal integration
- Improved retrieval accuracy
- Learning from user interactions

### 4. Cross-Reference Resolution

**Current Implementation Challenge:**
- Basic figure reference detection
- Limited handling of internal references
- No tracking of related content

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Add Reference Resolution Agent that:
  - Builds knowledge graph of document references
  - Tracks relationships between sections
  - Resolves indirect references
  - Maintains context across referenced content

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive information retrieval
- Better handling of document structure
- Improved context completeness
- Enhanced response accuracy

### 5. Response Generation Control

**Current Implementation Challenge:**
- Fixed response template
- Limited control over response format
- Basic evaluation metrics

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Deploy Response Formatting Agent that:
  - Adapts output format to query needs
  - Ensures response completeness
  - Validates factual accuracy
  - Maintains consistent style

**Benefits:**
- Customizable output formats
- Better quality control
- Enhanced user experience
- Consistent response style

### 6. Response Verification

**Current Implementation Challenge:**
- Basic factual accuracy checking
- Limited source attribution
- Static response templates
- Low accuracy scores in evaluation

**Agentic RAG Solution:**
- Deploy Response Verification Agent:
  - Source-based fact checking
  - Dynamic response structuring
  - Confidence scoring
  - Automated self-correction

**Expected Improvements:**
- Accuracy score target: >0.85
- Source attribution accuracy: >95%
- Response consistency: >90%
