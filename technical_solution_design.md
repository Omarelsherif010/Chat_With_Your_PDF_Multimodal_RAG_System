# Technical Solution Design for Multimodal RAG System

## Overview

This document outlines the technical solution design for a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that ingests and processes data from the paper "Attention Is All You Need". The system is designed to handle text, images, and tables, enabling it to answer complex queries by reasoning over multimodal data.

## Architecture

The architecture of the multimodal RAG system is divided into several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - **Purpose**: Extracts text, images, and tables from the PDF document.
   - **Implementation**: Handled by `src/data_extraction.py` using libraries like PyMuPDF for PDF processing, PIL for image handling, and custom functions for text and table extraction.

2. **Data Summarization**:
   - **Purpose**: Summarizes the extracted data to create a concise representation.
   - **Implementation**: Implemented in `src/data_summarize.py` using language models to generate summaries for text, tables, and images.

3. **Vector Store and Retrieval**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores vector embeddings and retrieves relevant information based on user queries.
   - **Implementation**: Utilizes Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval, as seen in `src/retrieval.py`. The system uses OpenAI embeddings for text and image data.

4. **Main Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Initializes the RAG system and handles user interactions.
   - **Implementation**: The main script `src/main.py` orchestrates the initialization and query handling processes.

## Frameworks and Tools

1. **PyMuPDF (fitz)**:
   - **Purpose**: PDF processing to extract text, images, and tables.
   - **Justification**: Provides efficient and reliable methods for handling PDF documents.

2. **PIL (Pillow)**:
   - **Purpose**: Image processing and conversion.
   - **Justification**: A widely-used library for image manipulation in Python.

3. **Pinecone**:
   - **Purpose**: Vector storage and retrieval.
   - **Justification**: Offers a scalable and efficient solution for managing vector embeddings, crucial for the RAG system's retrieval capabilities.

4. **OpenAI and Langchain**:
   - **Purpose**: Language models for text and image embeddings, and summarization.
   - **Justification**: Provides state-of-the-art models for natural language processing and understanding.

5. **Streamlit**:
   - **Purpose**: Web interface for user interaction.
   - **Justification**: Allows for rapid development of interactive web applications, making it ideal for prototyping and deployment.

## Justification of Choices

- **Scalability**: The use of Pinecone and OpenAI ensures that the system can handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: The modular design allows for easy integration of additional data types or processing steps.
- **Performance**: Leveraging state-of-the-art models and efficient libraries ensures high performance in data processing and retrieval tasks.

## Conclusion

This technical solution design provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and tools used in the multimodal RAG system. The choices made ensure that the system is robust, scalable, and capable of handling complex multimodal data queries effectively.
