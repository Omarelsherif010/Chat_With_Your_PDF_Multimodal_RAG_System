# Technical Solution Design for Multimodal RAG System

## Overview

This document outlines the technical solution design for a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that ingests and processes data from the paper "Attention Is All You Need". The system is designed to handle text, images, and tables, enabling it to answer complex queries by reasoning over multimodal data.

## Architecture

The architecture of the multimodal RAG system is divided into several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - **Purpose**: Extracts text, images, and tables from the PDF document.
   - **Implementation**: Handled by `src/data_extraction.py` using libraries like PyMuPDF for PDF processing, PIL for image handling, and custom functions for text and table extraction.

2. **Data Summarization**:
   - **Purpose**: Summarizes the extracted data to create a concise representation.
   - **Implementation**: Implemented in `src/data_summarize.py` using language models to generate summaries for text, tables, and images.

3. **Chunking and Retrieval**:
   - **Purpose**: Breaks down large text sections into manageable chunks and retrieves relevant information based on user queries.
   - **Implementation**: Utilizes a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to divide text into smaller, contextually meaningful chunks. This improves retrieval precision by ensuring that each chunk is a coherent unit of information. The retrieval process is managed by Pinecone, which uses vector embeddings to find the most relevant chunks for a given query.

4. **Vector Store and Retrieval**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores vector embeddings and retrieves relevant information based on user queries.
   - **Implementation**: Utilizes Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval, as seen in `src/retrieval.py`. The system uses OpenAI embeddings for text and image data.

5. **Main Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Initializes the RAG system and handles user interactions.
   - **Implementation**: The main script `src/main.py` orchestrates the initialization and query handling processes.

## Frameworks and Tools

1. **PyMuPDF (fitz)**:
   - **Purpose**: PDF processing to extract text, images, and tables.
   - **Justification**: Provides efficient and reliable methods for handling PDF documents.

2. **PIL (Pillow)**:
   - **Purpose**: Image processing and conversion.
   - **Justification**: A widely-used library for image manipulation in Python.

3. **Pinecone**:
   - **Purpose**: Vector storage and retrieval.
   - **Justification**: Offers a scalable and efficient solution for managing vector embeddings, crucial for the RAG system's retrieval capabilities.

4. **OpenAI and Langchain**:
   - **Purpose**: Language models for text and image embeddings, and summarization.
   - **Justification**: Provides state-of-the-art models for natural language processing and understanding.

5. **Streamlit**:
   - **Purpose**: Web interface for user interaction.
   - **Justification**: Allows for rapid development of interactive web applications, making it ideal for prototyping and deployment.

## Comparison of Data Ingestion Options

- **Unstructured Library**: Faced installation issues on Windows due to dependencies like `onnx`, making it unsuitable for this project.
- **llama_parse**: Successfully extracted text but required further debugging for tables and images, making it partially suitable.
- **PyMuPDF, PIL, and Custom Functions**: Provided a reliable and flexible solution for extracting text, images, and tables, making it the most suitable choice for this project.

## Comparison of ChromaDB and Pinecone

- **Performance**: Pinecone provides consistently fast query times, especially with large datasets.
- **Scalability**: Pinecone scales seamlessly, handling millions of vectors efficiently.
- **Integration**: Pinecone integrates smoothly with OpenAI and Langchain, reducing implementation complexity.
- **Ease of Use**: Pinecone's managed service reduces infrastructure management overhead.

## Justification for Choosing Pinecone

- **Scalability and Performance**: Essential for handling complex multimodal data efficiently.
- **Integration**: Simplifies the use of existing tools and frameworks.
- **Consistent Performance**: Ensures reliable and accurate query responses.

## Conclusion

This technical solution design provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and tools used in the multimodal RAG system. The choices made ensure that the system is robust, scalable, and capable of handling complex multimodal data queries effectively.
